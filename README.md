Here’s a complete and clean `README.md` that guides you from **zero to running** for a modular Go project like:

## 📘 `README.md` – Modular Go Microservices (User & Product Service)

```markdown
# 🧩 Go Modular Microservices: User & Product Service

This project contains two modular microservices built with Golang:

- 📦 `user-service`: CRUD for users using MongoDB
- 📦 `product-service`: CRUD for products (structure only)

Each service is a **standalone Go module**, following **Clean Architecture** and using **MongoDB** for persistence.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Go 1.21+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git (optional, but recommended)

---

```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-microservices.git
cd go-microservices
```

---

### 2. Run MongoDB

Start MongoDB using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

OR use Docker Compose (recommended):

```bash
docker-compose up -d mongodb
```

---

### 3. Run Services

> 🏁 From root directory

#### 🔹 Run User Service

```bash
go run ./user-service/cmd/main.go
```

Access: [http://localhost:8080/users](http://localhost:8080/users)

#### 🔹 Run Product Service

```bash
go run ./product-service/cmd/main.go
```

Access: [http://localhost:8081/products](http://localhost:8081/products)

---

### 4. API Example (User Service)

#### ✅ Create User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}'
```

#### 📄 Get All Users

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/users
```

---

## 🔧 Developer Workflow

### Use Makefile (Optional)

```bash
make run-user
make run-product
```

### Rebuild & Run All with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## 🧪 Testing (Optional Setup)

Each service can have its own `*_test.go` files and be tested individually:

```bash
cd user-service
go test ./...

cd ../product-service
go test ./...
```

---

## 🧼 Clean Up

```bash
docker stop mongodb
docker rm mongodb
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

- This structure supports **scaling into more services**.
- Follow [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) for consistency.
- Extend with API Gateway, gRPC, Kafka, etc.

If you’d like, I can generate:
- a complete `docker-compose.yml`
- sample `product-service` code
- a zipped project structure

Just say the word!
